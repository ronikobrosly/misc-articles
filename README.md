# misc-data-science-articles
A collection of DS blog posts, papers, videos, links, etc that I want to keep track of. None of these are related to data team leadership (see [this repo for those links](https://github.com/ronikobrosly/awesome-data-leadership))

[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) | The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc). Factors include: Codebase, Dependencies, Config, Backing services, Build, release, run, Processes, Port binding, Concurrency, Disposability, Dev/prod parity, Logs, and Admin processes | 2017
